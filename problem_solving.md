# problem solving:
   - ## think about the big picture
   - ## if the big picture is visual, do a sketch
   - ## break the problem into smaller problems
   - ## brainstorm solutions to those smaller problems
   - ## experiment
   - ## solve
   - ## combine smaller solutions together for a big solution
   - ## refine overall solution
   
# Brain Storm

   - ### what I already know related to the problem?
     #### (mental connection)
     
     
# Greedy methods
   ## Are used for solving optimization problems
   
# Dynamic programming
- choices
- constraints
- goal

 loop through the choices  
 on a choice, check constraints  
 if true - recurse on it
    
    goal - to reach a base case
 
# Backtracking

- ### decision point
    #### recursion represent decision remembered in the call stack
  - choice, decision
  - constraints  
    stop tracking
  - the Goal  
    this is a base case  - add to a sore results
    what am I trying to find (what's target?)
